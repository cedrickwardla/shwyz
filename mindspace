A shiver swivels up my shriveled spine,
		crosses the milky way,
			and sparks itself into the mindspace 
phenomena
	Creates the universe from a sensation akin to an eternity 
of mental spasms.
 
Celestial wormholes carve pathways into existence itself
					and spawn nebulous 
thoughts that float
about 
the nether of dark energy 	-	as if waiting
to be discovered by the eye of the beholder -
to be processed by the ultimate cortex into a sort of gray 
matter
tidally locked with superclusters of galactic atoms
in contemplation.
 
Subconsciousness swirls black holes
engulf the neuron stars projected astrally into the 
constellations of cranial ideas.
 
The ego undergoes an ominous electron storm
scatters throughout the psyche in supernovas that think in
higher dimensions.
 
All this to measure timeâ€™s distance
from then til now as incepted
as a story that actually existed.
